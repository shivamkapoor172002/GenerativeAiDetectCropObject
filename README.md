# Object Detection with YOLO

Welcome to the Object Detection with YOLO project, a versatile tool that utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for real-time object detection in images. This application allows you to upload an image or provide an image URL, and it will identify and highlight objects within the image.

## Overview

Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, and YOLO is a state-of-the-art model that excels at precisely this. Whether you need to identify objects within images, analyze visual data, or enhance your content with relevant tags, this application simplifies the process of object recognition.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Input Type**: Select whether you want to provide an image URL or upload an image file.

2. **Image URL**: If you select "Image URL," simply enter the URL of the image you want to analyze. The application will fetch the image and process it.

3. **File Upload**: If you select "File Upload," you can upload an image directly from your local device.

4. **Generate Object Detection**: Click the respective button to initiate the object detection process.

5. **View Results**: The application will identify and highlight objects within the image, providing you with labels and bounding boxes. You can also view the cropped images of the detected objects.

## Pretrained Model

This application leverages a pretrained YOLO model for object detection. The model is designed to recognize a wide range of objects in various contexts, making it suitable for a diverse set of applications.

## Customization

The application allows you to customize the object detection process by adjusting parameters such as the detection threshold. This flexibility enables you to fine-tune the model's behavior according to your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to install Streamlit and the Transformers library from Hugging Face. You can also explore different YOLO models and adapt them to suit your object detection needs.

## Contribute and Enhance

This project is open to contributions and enhancements. You can improve the user interface, integrate more advanced object detection models, or adapt it for specific applications and industries.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute it according to your requirements.

## Acknowledgments

This project harnesses the capabilities of the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Streamlit framework for creating user-friendly web applications.
